# Implmentation of a very simple chatbot in pytorch

- The implementation is straightforward with a Feed Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.
- Customization for your own use case is super easy. Just modify `intents.json` with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training (see below for more info).

## Customize
Have a look at [intents.json](intents.json). You can customize it according to your own use case. Just define a new `tag`, possible `patterns`, and possible `responses` for the chat bot. You have to re-run the training whenever this file is modified.
```console
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": [
        "Hi",
        "Hey",
        "How are you",
        "Is anyone there?",
        "Hello",
        "Good day"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Hey :-)",
        "Hello, thanks for visiting",
        "Hi there, what can I do for you?",
        "Hi there, how can I help?"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
